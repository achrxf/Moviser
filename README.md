# Moviser

Moviser is a web application that allows users to generate random movies or TV shows based on their preferences. Users can specify parameters such as media type (movie, TV show, or both), mood (happy, sad, or neutral), genre, and actor to customize their generated content. Additionally, users can discover a must-watch movie of the day with the "Must-Watch Today" feature.

This project was created as part of the ALX School curriculum.
